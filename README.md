# APANPS5210: Python for Data Analysis Team Project #

## Business Matching Project - Entity Resolution ##

### Project Description ###

This repository hosts our group project for the "Python for Data Analysis" course, Spring 2024 session. Our goal is to develop an algorithm capable of identifying and matching business entities across two distinct datasets, accounting for both exact and close matches. Utilizing advanced matching techniques, our solution evaluates matches with a confidence score, prioritizing high-confidence results (above 0.8). The repository includes datasets, exploratory Jupyter notebooks, source code, presentation materials, and results. This project not only showcases our technical approach to data matching challenges but also our collaborative effort in exploring various Python packages to enhance match accuracy.
